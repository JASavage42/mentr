o What	problem	does	your	app	solve?
      Our app, Mentr, seeks to solve the issue that students Junior and above are unsure of what to do after they graduate. You have been in school non-stop from the age of 5, and it is hard to imagine life in the corporate world. You have many questions of what's to come, and no one around to answer them.
   
 o How	does	your	app	solve	that	problem?
   Our app will pair junior level students with an industry professional to serve as a mentor. The mentor will already have gone through the trasntiion from campus to corporate, so they can relate to the student on a way that others can't. They will also be able to provide their knowledge of the industry and give the student some hints and tips so that when they graduate they'll come out better than a student without a mentor.
   
   We developed two apps concurrently with the intentions of merging them in the end. Turns out we were on different versions of Firebase and they didn't merge well so we scrapped this one that had most of our commits: https://github.com/JASavage42/codeathonproject.git. The application we are submitting had the functionality focused on the Chat portion while the other had the focus on the rest of the application.
